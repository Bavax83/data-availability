This repo tracks the developments on the effort to create a data availability layer. 
- [Reference Document](https://github.com/maticnetwork/data-availability/blob/master/reference%20document/Data%20Availability%20-%20Reference%20Document.pdf) containing the overall rationale, design and theoretical background.
- We have used [modified Substrate](https://github.com/maticnetwork/substrate/tree/da-poc) to implement our DA chain. We use [this repo](https://github.com/maticnetwork/da-light-client) to track the light client code. We use [forked Polkadot Apps](https://github.com/maticnetwork/apps) to design our DA block explorer. 
- [Implementation Ideas Wiki Page](https://github.com/maticnetwork/data-availability/wiki/Implementation-Ideas) containing the overview of the approaches taken during the construction of a PoC.
- [FAQ Page](https://github.com/maticnetwork/data-availability/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions)

This [Notion doc](https://www.notion.so/maticnetwork/Data-Availability-Survey-68319a4a2d144186ad7aa22c1981d56c) contains the raw ideas, some benchmarking, comparative studies and other unfinished work. This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OrW7p9R1aKGv83Bm2II1GyofvCywh9JsXMVhy_0CF9U/edit?usp=sharing) contains some numbers related to block sizes and block data.
